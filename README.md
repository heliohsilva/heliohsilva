## 👨‍💻 About me

I mainly work with **backend development for web applications**, with hands-on experience in **Python**, **Go**, and **JavaScript**.  

I care deeply about system fundamentals such as performance, concurrency, scalability, and resource efficiency, and I build software with these pillars in mind.

I’m currently exploring **distributed systems** and **cluster orchestration**, diving into scalability, performance, and system architecture concepts.  

I enjoy building backends that are fast, predictable, and easy to maintain.
